#  AJAX Exercises

Welcome to the  AJAX Exercises.  Here we will practice basic AJAX using fetch to retrieve data and output to html. Start by cloning this repository to your local computer.

In every exercise folder you will see an index.html. When you open up the code, there will be instructions comment in the Javascript section of the page. Follow the instructions to complete each assignment.

## IMPORTANT!!!

Using fetch on a local file requires an active server for an http or https request. Please use an IDE like VSCode that has the ability to create a live server as such:

Using this Live Server will allow you to access the JSON data.
